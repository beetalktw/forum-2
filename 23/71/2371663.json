{"forum": {"content": "I've been wondering if there is anyone like me thinking that English is like a cure which could heal your wounds or like a key which could lead people to the wonderland to escape from the tough reality for a moment. Through English, you could find more beautiful things, more  different people, and could help you to get to know other countries' cultures. You could read hundreds of thousands people's messages, their views, and you could understand lots of people's pain, and their emotions. Some are suffering, and some are bleeding. We all have pain, and you would find out that actually you're not that weird, not that alone, and you're just normal. There are amount of people just like you, which would make you less lonely, less empty and less suffocated. And you finally could breathe. I truly enjoy corresponding with people from all over the world or following lots of foreigners on Instagram. It's so much fun.
