{"forum": {"content": "So yes people asked about how to improve their English and this is my answer. My English journey started five years ago with Jane Austen, William Shakespeare and J RR Tolkien. I am not a fan of literature but I forced myself to immerse within it. As u can see that I checked through every single words that I don't understand in the text. The time was harsh and hellish but it somehow changed my life. If ur asking me how to improve English, I would simply just say: go to bookstore and pick up any book written in English even Twilight. Just start reading and speak it out.", "images": ["http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/f34513166adac4b9506a8cfb1d34a74b", "http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/77c49c9020b128ad6e5079ada1e8f11b", "http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/509006fa6573011aaadfb0de472fc6b4", "http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/a537bff11cfd99b788f511ef900e8f3f", "http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/a361c146812e7ce5b1d7b5873adf291b"], "urls": [], "title": "This reminds me how my English journey was started"}, "threadStatus": 0, "regionId": 886, "barStatus": 0, "barId": 724, "postBy": {"utc": 1451999431000, "level": 3, "location": "Taichung City\u00b7Taiwan", "avatar": "http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/-2470149618491121384", "name": "Erebus"}, "id": 2850755}
