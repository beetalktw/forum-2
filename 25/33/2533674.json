{"forum": {"content": "I saw a shooting star this night while I was laying on the ground and doing the leg lifting after today's training in NO.4 park. I was surprised at this stunning scene when I looked at the sky, the stars are filled with the sky, and I can't move my eyes away. Suddenly a shooting star crossed the sky. This brings me back to that night that we spent in the mountain, we sit in the car, talked, laughed, felt the beauty of the city. There was a shooting star at that night, I still remember the exciting and lovely face you have, that's the most beautiful thing I've never met. I made a wish just like that day, I hope that the fortune and happiness always come with my beloved people.", "images": ["http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/b2a56053485a2067679cccaa5b0e93cf"], "urls": [], "title": "I saw a shooting star this night"}, "threadStatus": 0, "regionId": 886, "barStatus": 0, "barId": 13, "postBy": {"utc": 1447605183000, "level": 5, "location": "\u65b0\u5317\u5e02\u00b7\u53f0\u7063", "avatar": "http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/436273022766474528", "name": "scott"}, "id": 2533674}
