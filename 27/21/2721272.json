{"forum": {"content": "Hi guys, <br /><br />I'm a native Australian, born and raised in Sydney. I wish to make new friends in Taiwan and I can assist anyone with any questions regarding Australia/Sydney life.<br /><br />One of my closest Taiwanese friends just left to Australia today for working holiday so I wish to find new friends to fill in the void.<br /><br />My Chinese is okay, but I cannot read or write well. So it would be easier to speak Chinese or to converse in English.<br /><br />Looking forward to make new friends :)<br />Andy", "images": ["http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/b3303f4e96a3e8229acea9eea380d93a"], "urls": [], "title": "Australian here.."}, "threadStatus": 1, "regionId": 886, "barStatus": 0, "barId": 743, "postBy": {"utc": 1450172714000, "level": 1, "location": "Taipei City\u00b7Taiwan", "avatar": "http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/-8743594638885083392", "name": "Yuey"}, "id": 2721272}
