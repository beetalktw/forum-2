{"forum": {"content": "Well it's really hard to get taiwanese ppl who speak English on skout or bee talk... It's either rejecting for my simple greeting or try to make me speak Chinese... The thing is.. I typed seriously slow in Chinese and I don't want to spend any single time on typing finger by finger... that bothers me a lot actually lol and the thing leads to such serious fact in taiwanese is due to its surrounding and environment. Ppl even think that foreigners are learning Chinese as well so why do we need English? Well to me, English is just another tool that is built simply on either typing or speaking on it ~  so I do appreciate to meet any ppl who can knock me on English lol even just a simple greeting", "images": ["http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/a20935bc85a4e5d35cb514ee487a4e5d"], "urls": [], "title": "The environment"}, "threadStatus": 0, "regionId": 886, "barStatus": 0, "barId": 724, "postBy": {"utc": 1450888979000, "level": 3, "location": "Taichung City\u00b7Taiwan", "avatar": "http://filestoresg1.beetalkmobile.com:8081/file/-2470149618491121384", "name": "Erebus"}, "id": 2773851}
